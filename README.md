# Megnat

Megnat is a **third-party** / **non-official** wallet app for Tangem cards.

It is created to unleash the full potential of Tangem cards and provide a possibly better experience for certain use cases.

> Currently only available on Android, iOS support is probably coming.

## Highlights

- ðŸ“‘ Multiple wallets on a single card.
- ðŸ”‘ Import & sign with **private key wallet** (so your wallet with vanity address can be safely stored on the card).
- ðŸ’° Respect dApps' gas price settings, big big money saved over time.
- ðŸ”Œ Custom chains support for advanced users.

## Downloads

You can find the latest version of the app on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vilicvane/megnat/releases/latest).

## A signing app

Megnat uses WalletConnect just like Tangem, but is solely built as a **signing app**, meaning built-in token management and DeFi features are non-goals.

## EVM-only

Currently it is **EVM-only**, and there is no plan to support other chains unless it is highly requested.

## Roadmap

- [ ] iOS support.
- [ ] Security key.
- [ ] Transaction data decoding.
- [ ] Pending transactions (to replace or cancel).
