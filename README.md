# Megnat

Megnat is a **third-party** / **non-official** wallet app for Tangem cards.

It is created to unleash the full potential of Tangem cards and provide a possibly better experience for certain use cases.

> Currently only available on Android, iOS support is probably coming.

## Highlights

- 🔑 Import & sign with **private key wallet** (so your wallet with vanity address can be safely stored on the card).
- 💰 Respect dApps' gas price settings, big big money saved over time.
- 🔌 Custom chains support for advanced users.

## A signing app

Megnat uses WalletConnect just like Tangem, but is solely built as a **signing app**, meaning built-in token management and DeFi features are non-goals.

## EVM-only

Currently it is **EVM-only**, and there is no plan to support other chains unless it is highly requested.

## License

This license is yet to be decided. The source code is made public for transparency only, and thus no permission is granted.
